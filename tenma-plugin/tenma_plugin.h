/*
 * tenma native plugins, ABI version 1.
 *
 * A plugin is a shared library that exports one symbol:
 *
 *     const TenmaPlugin *tenma_plugin_init(const TenmaApi *api, uint32_t abi);
 *
 * tenma loads it with dlopen before any worker starts (`tenma --plugin ./libname.so`, or `plugins` in
 * tenma.json) and calls it once; the plugin keeps `api` for the life of the process and returns its
 * table, or NULL if `abi` is not the version it was built for. Memory crosses the boundary only as
 * pointer and length, valid for the duration of the call: whoever needs it longer copies it.
